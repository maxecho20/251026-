Except as explicitly stated in these Terms, PoseShift reserves all rights in and to our services.</p>
        <h3>Usage Restrictions</h3>

        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>At PoseShift, we stand by the quality and effectiveness of our SaaS products. However, we have a strict no-refund policy due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription-Based Service:</strong> Our service operates on a subscription model, which means you are paying for ongoing access to our platform and its features.</li>
            <li><strong>Immediate Access:</strong> Upon subscription, you receive immediate access to our services. This instant value makes it difficult to provide refunds once the service has been utilized.</li>
            <li><strong>Preventative Considerations:</strong> We encourage all potential subscribers to thoroughly review our product, pricing, and terms before making a purchase decision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>We understand that your needs may change, and you might wish to cancel your subscription. Our cancellation process is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexible Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time by following the cancellation process outlined in your account settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Continued Service After Cancellation:</strong> Once you initiate the cancellation process, your service will remain active for the remainder of your current billing cycle. You will not be charged again after that period ends.</li>
            <li><strong>No Partial Refunds:</strong> As our service is provided on a subscription basis, we do not offer partial refunds for the unused portion of a billing cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Please be aware that upon cancellation, you will have a limited time to export your data from our platform. After this period, your data may be deleted and will not be recoverable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER POSESHIFT NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES.</p>
